#contributing to globalscript

Aight girlies, boios, helicopters, and others. Welcome to the contributing tutorial. Here's what you need to do:

### If you wrote a compiler:

#### Step 1: Put the compiler in a separate repository on GitHub.

We won't accept compilers that aren't open source because **sp00py**.

#### Step 2: Add to our list.

Create a new issue with the correct tag. We need links to the repository and some info about it.

Make sure:

-it's obvious what platform or language the compiler is meant to run on

-the compiler supports all features of a recent or current version of globalscript

-the compiler can be used from the command line

### If you want to modify code in the repository:

Fork, edit, pull request.



(oh yeah, also describe what you did in the pull request so we aren't clueless)
